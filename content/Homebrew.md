- # Secure Shelter
	
	3th-level conjuration (ritual)
	
	**Casting Time**: 10 minutes
	
	**Range**: 60 feet
	
	**Components**: V, S, M (a chip of stone, a drop of water, and a splinter of wood)
	
	**Duration**: 8 hours
	
	**Classes**: [ranger](https://www.5esrd.com/classes/ranger), [wizard](https://www.5esrd.com/classes/wizard)
	
	You conjure a sturdy cottage or lodge made of material that is common in the area where the spell is cast. The floor is level, clean, and dry. The lodging resembles a normal cottage, with a sturdy door, two shuttered windows, and a small fireplace.
	
	The shelter must be heated as a normal dwelling, and extreme heat adversely affects it and its occupants. The dwelling does, however, provide considerable security otherwise – it is as strong as a normal stone building, regardless of its material composition. The dwelling resists flames and fire as if it were stone. It is impervious to normal ranged weapon attacks (but not the sort cast by siege engines or giants).
	
	The door, shutters, and even chimney are secure against intrusion, the former two being secured with [arcane lock](https://www.5esrd.com/spellcasting/all-spells/a/arcane-lock) and the latter by an iron grate at the top and a narrow flue.
	
	In addition, these three areas are protected by an [alarm](https://www.5esrd.com/spellcasting/all-spells/a/alarm) spell. Finally, an [unseen servant](https://www.5esrd.com/spellcasting/all-spells/u/unseen-servant) is conjured to provide service to you for the duration of the shelter.
	
	The secure shelter contains crude furnishings – eight bunks, a trestle table, eight stools, and a writing desk.
	
	This spell cannot be cast indoors.

# Items
## NET (1 GP) [5e24]
When you take the Attack action, you can replace one of your attacks with throwing a Net. Target a creature you can see within 15 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and Proficiency Bonus) or have the Restrained condition until it escapes. The target succeeds automatically if it is Huge or larger. To escape, the target or a creature within 5 feet of it must take an action to make a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check, freeing the Restrained creature on a success. Destroying the Net (AC 10; 5 HP; Immunity to Bludgeoning, Poison, and Psychic damage) also frees the target, ending the effect.

## BALL BEARINGS (1 GP) [5e24]
As a action, you can spill Ball Bearings from their pouch. They spread to cover a level, 10-foot square area within 10 feet of yourself. A creature that enters this area for the first time on a turn must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or have the Prone condition. It takes 10 minutes to recover the Ball Bearings.

## CALTROPS (l GP) [5e24]
As a action, you can spread Caltrops from their bag to cover a 5-foot-square area within 5 feet of yourself. A creature that enters this area for the first time on a turn must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 1 Piercing damage and have its Speed reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn. It takes 10 minutes to recover the Caltrops.
