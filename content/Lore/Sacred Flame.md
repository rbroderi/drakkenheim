# The Sacred Flame: A Primer

The Sacred Flame, also known as the Divine Light, is the dominant religion in the realms of Caspia, Elyria, Westemär, and neighboring domains. Its beliefs and practices intertwine deeply with the social, political, and cultural life of these lands. Rooted in ancient myth, the faith draws inspiration from the eternal struggle between light and darkness, good and evil. While the religion does not center around the worship of a deity, its followers revere a transcendent divine force symbolized as the Sacred Flame—an eternal light that guides them toward righteousness, justice, and redemption.

#### Origin and Mythology

The Sacred Flame’s history began over a thousand years ago with Saint Tarna, a once-feared warlord whose soul was transformed by a divine encounter with angels. Guided by their wisdom, Tarna learned to channel the Sacred Flame, becoming the first paladin. She used this power to destroy a malevolent sorcerer-king, sacrificing her own life in the process. After her martyrdom, her disciples spread her teachings, forming the foundation of the Faith of the Sacred Flame.

The Sacred Flame represents the eternal force of light and goodness, standing in direct opposition to the forces of darkness and corruption, led by Angra Mainyu, The Destructive Spirit. It is a symbol of divine will and cosmic balance, a manifestation of moral order that must constantly be defended and nourished.

#### Core Beliefs and Tenets

Good Thoughts, Good Words, Good Deeds

The Sacred Flame embodies a set of guiding principles that shape the lives of its followers. These core tenets reflect both Zoroastrian concepts and the teachings of Saint Tarna:

- The Hearth: A symbol of compassion and community, this tenet encourages followers to offer warmth, sustenance, and shelter to those in need. For the Sacred Flame’s adherents, nourishing others with compassion upholds the natural harmony of the world.
    
- The Lantern: This principle illuminates the path of truth and wisdom. Darkness, whether physical or metaphorical, hides the truth, but the Sacred Flame reveals it. Believing in the ongoing battle between the divine light (Asha) and the darkness of Druj (falsehood and corruption), followers of the Sacred Flame must seek the light of truth, never silencing it, and always confronting the darkness with integrity.
    
- The Torch: The Sacred Flame demands righteous action against evil. Its followers are charged with upholding justice and combating wrongdoing. They believe it is their imperative to actively choose good, as it is believed that each person plays a role in the eternal struggle against the forces of chaos and darkness.
    
- The Candle: A symbol of hope and redemption, this principle teaches that even the smallest light can dispel shadows. Followers of the Sacred Flame believe that no soul is beyond redemption, and they are encouraged to show mercy and offer salvation to those in spiritual darkness. They hope for Frashokereti—the eventual renewal of the world where all souls are purified, and darkness is eradicated.
    

#### Holy Sites and Symbols

The Sacred Flame is often represented by a lit candle or a goblet of fire. Followers gather in circles around roaring fires during worship ceremonies, their hymns offering praise and seeking guidance from the Flame. The Ember’s Hymn, the sacred text of the religion, contains prayers, teachings, and hymns that reinforce the faith’s central principles.

Holy sites dedicated to the Sacred Flame are abundant throughout the realms, from small village shrines with simple bonfire pits to grand cathedrals adorned with stained glass, murals, and statues of saints. The most sacred of these is the Cathedral of Saint Tarna in the city of Lumen, which houses a continual golden flame that represents the undying light of the Sacred Flame.

#### The Role of Flamekeepers and Clerics

The clergy of the Sacred Flame are known as Flamekeepers, most of whom are women. They wear flowing white, yellow, and gold vestments, reflecting their devotion to the light. Flamekeepers take vows of poverty, living in commonwealth and dedicating their lives to serving others. They preside over worship services, offer spiritual counsel, and maintain the sacred fire.

Though the hierarchical structure of the faith emphasizes the role of Flamekeepers, people of any gender may serve as clerics and paladins, rising to positions of honor and reverence. Some of these clerics become living vessels for the Sacred Flame itself, channeling divine magic to heal, protect, and illuminate the path of truth.

#### Paladins of the Sacred Flame

Paladins are revered as holy warriors, inspired by Saint Tarna’s example of self-sacrifice and righteous action. They channel the warrior spirit, and are charged with defending the world from the forces of darkness. Paladins take sacred oaths of devotion, redemption, and vigilance, swearing to root out corruption and destroy evil in all its forms.

The Knights of the Silver Order, a renowned knightly fellowship. They are the most celebrated of the militant orders that actively engage in crusades against supernatural threats and dark forces. These warriors, embody the sacred duty of fighting for divine order and the triumph of light.

#### Afterlife and Cosmic Balance

The Sacred Flame teaches that upon death, righteous souls after passing the Bridge of Judgement are guided by the divine light to the land of eternal dawn. This celestial place, where the light of the Sacred Flame burns eternally, is where souls reside in peace, free from the darkness that seeks to corrupt them. Here, they stand as eternal guardians against the shadow, their luminous souls serving as a bulwark to protect the realms from the encroaching dark.
