> - **Description:** Delerium is the mineral that was spread over the city of Drakkenheim 15 years ago by the Meteorite that largely destroyed the city. Samples of Delerium are classed both by size and condition and loosely classified as dust, chips, fragments, shards, crystals, and geodes. The price of the Delerium directly corresponds to the size of the piece. 
<br/>Delerium affects the city of Drakkenheim by faintly glowing. This glow, called Du≈°a grada (The Soul of the City) by the locals is noted to be "perhaps the only beautiful thing left to see in the city". The color of this glow is one that doesn't exist in the real world, but it's a sort of purple-green-yellow color called "octarine," the color of magic. Delerium glows more strongly in the presence of magic or moonlight. 
<br/>Raw samples of the mineral elicit a sensation of electricity and have a distinctive smell of ozone like a strong, lightning-heavy thunderstorm. In addition, magic-users in immediate proximity to Delerium are able to sense the substance, which to them gives off an alluring aura
