<br/> [[Aldor the Immense.jpg|show to players]]
>- **Age:** %AGE%
> - **Description:** Massive human man who must be nearly seven feet tall and almost as wide. He is garbed in masterfully tailored jet-black silk that flatters his obese frame: a frilled doublet, padded breeches, and riding gloves, all worn under a great fur-lined cloak, topped with a feathered cap. Each piece is delicately embroidered with elegant silver trim. The smell of fine tobacco mixed with perfume hangs in the air around him. He smokes a fine black pipe and drinks from a bottle of vintage wine, a rakish grin on his flabby face.
