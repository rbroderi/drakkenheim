>- **Age:** %AGE%
> - **Description:** Crowe is a quiet family man who stands six feet tall with fiery red hair and beard. Heâ€™s often drenched in sweat and soot, and wears a greasy pair of old goggles. Crowe proudly demonstrates the high quality of his work to customers, and openly criticizes the shoddy workmanship of their existing equipment.
> - **Personality:** Cordial
 
 >[!NOTE] Background
 >
 >He spends most of his days repairing broken gear, and his evenings at the Bark and Buzzard, before returning home to his wife Moira and daughters Emma and Sybil. Although he lacks the spellcasting abilities to work with delerium, he dreams of one day creating a masterpiece out of the meteoric iron found in Drakkenheim.
