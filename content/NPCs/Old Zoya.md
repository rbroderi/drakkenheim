>[!INFO] Old Zoya

<br/> [[Old Zoya.jpg|show to players]]
>- **Age:** Old
> - **Description:** Old Zoya has been a fixture of Emberwood Village since before anyone can remember. Elves age much slower than humans do, even so, Zoya _looks_ old. None know her true age and few are brave enough to ask. She lives just outside Emberwood Village proper, in a hut next to an ancient standing stone. "Which came first, the Zoya or the Stone?" is a local variant on the much more common chicken and egg question.
> - **Personality:** Cooky
 
 >[!NOTE] Background
 >The goodly people of the village attend their ceremonies and worship the Sacred Flame, and whisper about the old witch who lives in the wood and worships old gods. But there's not one who hasn't made the trip out to her cottage, at least as a youth on a dare, and many who have gone to seek her advice or treatment if conventional means did not work. Those who have talked to her find her pleasant, if she does tend to ramble. She is stooped, and walks with a cane clutched in her gnarled hands. Her clothes are old and worn, but well mended. In the days before the meteor, one could always find wild animals there, for they had no fear of her, and a garden overgrown with vegetables, and flowers, and herbs of all kinds.
