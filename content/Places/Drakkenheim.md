> - **Description:** Drakkenheim is the capital of the kingdom of Westemär, one of the three main powers on the continent alongside Elyria and Caspia. However, the political state of Westemär is uncertain. The destruction of Drakkenheim by the meteorite 15 years ago caused a Civil War for succession that ultimately left the nation with no central power. You might have heard references to “the war” made by some of the hooded lanterns, as before returning to Drakkenheim the Lord Commander fought in the civil war for the Restorationists.

>[!NOTE] Background
>Drakkenheim is no more. Struck by a falling star, the city bathed in eldritch fire on that woeful eve. The tumultuous aftermath brought chaos, families torn asunder, and the kingdom shattered. Fifteen years later, monsters stalk the haunted streets of Drakkenheim. Caught amidst rival factions struggling to rule the rubble, three unlikely partners venture forth into the crumbling city in search of riches, renown, and revenge.
