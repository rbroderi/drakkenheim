> - **Description:** Drakkenheim is the capital of the kingdom of Westemär, one of the three main powers on the continent alongside Elyria and Caspia. However, the political state of Westemär is uncertain. The destruction of Drakkenheim by the meteorite 15 years ago caused a Civil War for succession that ultimately left the nation with no central power. You might have heard references to “the war” made by some of the hooded lanterns, as before returning to Drakkenheim the Lord Commander fought in the civil war for the Restorationists.

>[!NOTE] Background
>Drakkenheim is no more. Struck by a falling star, the city bathed in eldritch fire on that woeful eve. The tumultuous aftermath brought chaos, families torn asunder, and the kingdom shattered. Fifteen years later, monsters stalk the haunted streets of Drakkenheim. Caught amidst rival factions struggling to rule the rubble, four unlikely partners venture forth into the crumbling city in search of riches, renown, and revenge.

The proud and prosperous heart of Westemär. The even-handed rule of House von Kessel fosters a vibrant and industrious spirit that welcomes folk throughout the realm and beyond. The city is an international hub for trade and culture, known for its architectural wonders. Castle Drakken looms above the city, its sharp-pointed towers standing guard over the city. The dome of St. Vitruvio’s Cathedral welcomes any followers of the faith who seek the warm glow of its flame. Rising above both, the tallest landmark in the city, the Inscrutable Tower. It's dazzling height houses untold magical secrets and arcane knowledge.

And beyond that, more locations define the cityscape. The mighty Drann River which splits the city in half, the only gap in the imposing walls that separate the thriving inner city from the ramshackle neighborhoods without. And the gates which allow passage through the walls, offering a glimmer of hope for a better life. The Queen’s Garden, a sanctuary of peace and natural beauty amidst the hustle and bustle of the city, a testament to Westemär’s queens and royal consorts. The Cosmological Clocktower, a mechanical wonder that once tracked not just time, but the grand cosmic dance of the planets and stars, before stopping some ninety years ago. And, of course, Slaughterstone Square, where order is upheld by the executioner’s blade.

Home. A hundred thousand people, give or take, call this city their home.

Autumntide (September) 16, the year 1111. 8.11 pm. Dusk has faded into night. Children rush home before they get in trouble, taverns and inns are filled with laughter. Others still are headed home under a clear sky, finishing their business for the day. Home, family, and a hearty meal await them.

Few look up. A flamekeeper and a pyre priest on the steps of the cathedral. A blacksmith wipes their brow, taking a quick break. A boy, wide-eyed and easily impressed, tugs at his sister's sleeve to get her to look as well.

A dot. Nothing more than that; a strange star in the sky where there normally was none.

8.12 pm. That's not a star. Stars don't swell and grow. Stars don't shine with this eerie glow—purple and green and yellow and all and nothing, swirling and writhing and crackling with an unknown energy. Octarine, it will be called. An otherworldly, octarine glow – eldritch magic hurtling towards the city with incomprehensible speed.

8.13 pm. The girl grabs her brother and presses him against her, embracing him, shielding him. The smith drops their tools in a panic and flees inside. The flamekeeper prays, and the priest mumbles a paraphrase of Lucretia Mathias' teachings. “One day soon, we will near the end–”

The meteor crashes.

Drakkenheim. One hundred thousand people, give or take, call this city their home. Only a fraction of a fraction of that number escape the city. A fraction of a fraction that nonetheless do not leave unscathed. Flame have mercy on those who live. The tens of thousands killed in the impact are the lucky ones. Others transform — horribly mutated, shattered minds grasping at incomprehensible straws, attacking those who didn't transform. Monsters now, whose sole existence is to live out some twisted aspect of their past lives, to terrorize those who venture into the ruins, or perhaps to guard the crater and what it spread.

By day the city is covered by mists, which lift as a corona of octarine light shimmers in the night sky, all conjured by the invisible haze which radiates through the ruins and stretches out for miles. Thinner at the edge than its core, something burgeons within. Shards, fragments from the meteor, delerium, shimmering with that same octarine glow, that unbridled magical potential. Its value not to be understated, its madness not to be underestimated.

Fifteen years have passed. Fifteen years of struggle settling into relative peace. Fifteen years since soldiers, smugglers, mages, fanatics, and other adventurers began flocking to the city, each with their own reasons.

Even so, beware. To the thug looking to make a quick score, to the mage excited to study the unknown, to the paladin who would exterminate this evil, to the soldier seeking reclaim their home and restore order, to the pilgrim who would worship it, to the fresh-faced adventurer about to venture forth in search of glory, wealth, knowledge, or some personal quest, beware. For there is no place in the world more dangerous and deadly than Drakkenheim.

(Stories, all of them. Stories that you've just heard on your journey, coming from the mouth of your affable employer. Eren Marlowe, a middle-aged human who hired you to guard their covered wagon, chock full of rations, water, wine and other supplies, heading toward Emberwood Village. Just five miles south of Drakkenhiem, the once sleepy village was turned into a boomtown by the fortune-seekers, mercenaries, and prospectors seeking to explore the ruined city. Eren’s been talking non-stop during the journey so far, it seems, loading onto you these tales of Drakkenheim, and then they turn to you.

"But I've been saying so much! You probably know my life story by now and I barely know a lick about you. I hope you don’t mind me inquiring, but I would love to know more about you, and why you're heading to Drakkenheim.")
