> - **Description:** The Hendrix Farm is one of the only occupied farmsteads remaining in Emberwood Village. It was once run by an old human [commoner](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16829-commoner) named Elijah Hendrix, until his crops became contaminated, his livestock perished, and his wife grew ill and passed away after the meteor fell. The fallow fields are devoid of crops and no longer used for agricultural production. Instead, they are littered with small campfires and tents for the passing pilgrims. The large wooden barn and nearby farmhouse are kept in good repair, though all the farm equipment and ploughs were long ago dismantled for parts.
 

>[!NOTE] Background
Elijah Hendrix gave up on farming, and nearly gave up on life as well. However, several years ago, [Lucretia Mathias](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4086127-lucretia-mathias) stayed at his farmhouse during her first pilgrimage to Drakkenheim. Her words inspired him with renewed purpose, and he now offers shelter to any future pilgrims of the Falling Fire who are making the trek into Drakkenheim.

**[[Nathaniel Flint]]** and many members of the Falling Fire gather here as their last stop before heading further into the ruins. At any given time there may be as many as fifty [commoners](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16829-commoner) congregating here with their wagons. Though he has been invited to come take the Sacrament himself many times, Farmer Hendrix believes it is his destiny to wait here until the very last pilgrim comes.
