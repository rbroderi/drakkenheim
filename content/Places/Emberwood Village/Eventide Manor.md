> - **Description:** This manor house on the south end of town burned down many years ago. It was once owned by a mysterious elven woman who had a child with a local craftsman, but was abandoned after she passed away and the boy was taken by the Amethyst Academy. Since it caught fire, none have come to claim or repair it. Children now tell tales of the strange noises coming from the cellar of the house, and how the charred doors and windows open and close on their own.

>[!NOTE] Background
>Unbeknownst to the folk of Emberwood Village, this house was owned by a former Archmage of the Amethyst Academy. Behind an illusory wall in the cellar protected by a [glyph of warding](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2125-glyph-of-warding) is a [teleportation circle](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2276-teleportation-circle) used today by members of the Amethyst Academy to come and go from their distant strongholds. Academy members only enter or exit the manor under the effects of an [invisibility](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2159-invisibility) spell, hence the children’s rumours.
