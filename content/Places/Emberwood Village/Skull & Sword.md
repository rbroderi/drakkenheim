>[!NOTE] Background
This dingy saloon was converted from an old farmstead. A jawless skull impaled upon a rusty sword is embedded beside the main doors: no one knows who it was or who did them in, but it’s tradition to make a macabre greeting to the skull on your way into the bar. Inside the establishment is a rowdy environment - brawls and fist fights happen daily, and several ruffians are thrown out nightly.

The Skull & Sword is a popular place for scoundrels and misfits to gather thanks to the cheap mead and liquor served here. It may very well be the best place in Emberwood Village to pick up rumours from the city, but you may want to keep a low profile hanging out around there, or be ready to draw swords for looking at someone the wrong way.

The establishment is run by a half-orc [gladiator](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16903-gladiator) named Frida Longhorn, who keeps most people in check. Despite the rough reputation of the establishment, Frida is pretty good at keeping the peace and making sure there are no killings or broken windows in her bar. Her business partner, a halfling [spy](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17021-spy) named Cuff Goldburg, is usually sitting at one of the back tables with [Blackjack Mel](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4086138-scoundrel). Cuff typically excuses himself when Blackjack Mel deals with mercenaries and adventurers.

The [Queen of Thieves](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4086133-queen-of-thieves) bankrolls the bar, ensuring the flow of cheap booze (which is almost all stolen). While commonfolk in Emberwood Village believe the Skull & Sword is a hub for unlawful activity, most of what goes on here is above board aside from a few sketchy meetings. The real dirty deals and smuggling happen in Buckledown Row where the other factions can’t easily interfere.

- A mug of cheap mead is 5 copper pieces. Brandy, rum, vodka, and gin are 1 silver.
- Blackjack Mel is here every night, where he has a favourite spot amongst the back tables with 7 (2d6) [thugs](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17035-thug). He’s eager to meet potential recruits in a private booth in the back corner.
