> - **Description:** Upon a small hill overlooking the village is the impressive Red Lion Hotel. Before the meteor struck it was known as Stavros Manor. The three-story manor is made of red brick. It features lion-shaped gargoyles, large glass-paned windows, and embossed wooden doors painted green. The estate includes a dozen well-appointed bedrooms, each with their own private bath and common room. A full service staff provides patrons’ every need. Meals are taken in a sumptuous dining room outfitted with an impressive crystal chandelier, and drinks are served in a vast parlor furnished with fine antiques and decorated with various sculptures, paintings, and bookshelves. Each room features a great hearth and lovely views which overlook the village or the surrounding countryside.

>[!NOTE] Background
It is home to a human [noble](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16966-noble) named Kosta Stavros who served as Reeve of Emberwood Village. After narrowly avoiding destitution when Drakkenheim was destroyed, Stavros converted his home into a hotel that serves wealthy explorers, merchants, and nobles conducting business near Drakkenheim. He is an older man with a sallow face, thinning hair, and monocle, always garbed in a rich blue vest and doublet.

The Reeve has abandoned his civic duties, and is now little more than another business owner in the town. However, he still lords his imagined authority and privilege over others in the village, and prefers to share wine and gossip with travelers and merchants than deal with common folk. He regards the idea of adventuring in Drakkenheim as a sort of sport. He often makes wagers on who will die first amongst any adventuring groups who visit the Red Lion Hotel.

- Kosta Stavros loves the fine arts, especially sculpture, paintings, and literature. He’s assembled a vast collection of art objects recovered by adventurers from the ruins, and exchanges coin or credit towards accommodation for works in good condition.
- [[River]] of the Amethyst Academy stays at the Red Lion Hotel. She’s happy to chat, but prefers to conduct business privately. She asks any potential new associates of the Amethyst Academy to meet with her later at [Eckerman Mill](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dodr/outside-the-walls#EckermanMill) (see [chapter 6](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dodr/outside-the-walls)).
- The Ironhelm Dwarves (see [Smithy on the Scar](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dodr/outside-the-walls#SmithyOnTheScar) in [chapter 6](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dodr/outside-the-walls)) keep rooms here, along with many merchants who operate in Caravan Court and one or two groups of wealthy [rival adventurers](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dodr/running-the-campaign#RivalAdventurers).
- Rooms are 25 gp per night and include meals.
- Wine and liquors are sold at 100 gold per bottle.
