> - **Description:** This fortified stone watchtower is the tallest structure in Emberwood Village, and lies upon the road on the north edge of town. A two-storey wooden house abuts the base. Inside is a small kitchen, a mess hall, and about two dozen bunk beds. The tower has three main levels, one serving as a meeting room, another as armoury, and the final as a private chamber for the watchmaster. Outside the tower the Hooded Lanterns keep a small training yard and a modest stable large enough for six horses. Nearby, a covered wooden bridge crosses the narrow Timberwash stream and leads out of Emberwood Village towards Drakkenheim.

>[!NOTE] Background
This location once served as the initial outpost for the Hooded Lanterns until they successfully established a base of operations within the city proper, and the remnants of a much larger military camp are scattered about the nearby field. Now, only a small detachment keeps watch in Emberwood Village.

- A small force of a dozen Hooded Lantern [scouts](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17007-scout) are posted here, with one or two other squads out on patrol in the countryside.
- Raine Highlash, an [urban ranger](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4086142-urban-ranger) with a predatory look about her, serves as watch captain.
- [Ansom](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4086142-urban-ranger) or [Petra Lang](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4086142-urban-ranger) report in here regularly at the behest of the Lord Commander, and use the outpost to meet with mercenaries and adventurers.
