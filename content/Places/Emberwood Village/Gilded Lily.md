>[!NOTE] Background
This lavish two-storey building is surrounded by a veranda decorated with a swirling lily motif and painted purple. It has ornate golden glowing lanterns hanging between the veranda arches and within its curtained windows. Inside, four large golden lamps light a small stage set before rows of candlelit tables. Floral arrangements line the walls. The well-stocked bar displays wines and spirits from across the world. The Gilded Lily is owned by a human [noble](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16966-noble) named Mr. Killian Vandire, but the exquisite hostess Madam Rochelle (a human [spy](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17021-spy)) runs the business and organizes the nightly performance acts. The tavern is a popular place to share company, gossip, and have a few drinks, and many adventurers make their last stop here for some good memories before trudging into the dismal ruins.

- Drinks cost 5 silver: wine, spirits, and coffee only, no beer or food is served here.

“Mike” was the master of ceremonies who went missing shortly after the meteor fell. One of Mike’s final wishes was to open the stage to any performer for magic shows, musical numbers, poetry readings, performances, or storytelling. The Gilded Lily is willing to host any performer who wishes to take the stage and though they do not pay their acts, they do put a hat out so patrons can toss a coin to their performer if they like the show.

- Any sort of act is allowed in the Gilded Lily. Performers may tell a story, recite a poem, sing, or play an instrument. Spellcasters might put on a magic show, and even demonstrations of acrobatic or athletic skill are welcome. Player characters are invited to be as creative as they want to earn some extra coins.
- Player characters who take to the stage may make a skill check related to their performance: [acrobatics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Acrobatics), [arcana](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Arcana), [athletics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics), [history](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#History), and [performance](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Performance) are all suitable ways to represent their act.
- Characters are paid in tips: they receive an amount of gold based on their skill check result:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|9 or less|The character is booed off the stage, and receives no gold for their performance. If this happens three or more times, they are banned from ever performing again.|
|10 to 14|Characters collect 2d6 gp in coins from tips.|
|15 to 19|Characters earn 5d6 gp from the impressed audience|
|20 or higher|The wonderful performance earns 10d6 gold pieces, and characters are invited to perform an encore performance. However, characters must exceed their previous check result to win further encores.|
