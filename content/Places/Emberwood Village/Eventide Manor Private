Eventide Manor
>[!NOTE] Background
>Unbeknownst to the folk of Emberwood Village, this house was owned by a former Archmage of the Amethyst Academy. Behind an illusory wall in the cellar protected by a [glyph of warding](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2125-glyph-of-warding) is a [teleportation circle](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2276-teleportation-circle) used today by members of the Amethyst Academy to come and go from their distant strongholds. Academy members only enter or exit the manor under the effects of an [invisibility](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2159-invisibility) spell, hence the children’s rumours.
