<br/> [[Bark & Buzzard.jpg|show to players]]
> - **Description:** Nestled amongst the residential cottages of Emberwood Village, this small one-level public house is a popular spot for locals and adventurers seeking a peaceful and laid back place to unwind. The sign hanging above the door depicts a cartoonish vulture and a bloodhound, both smiling pleasantly. The public house has a cozy and familial character: there’s no proper bar, nor any walls separating the kitchen from the dining room. Instead, a few benches are arranged beside the main cask, and about a dozen round tables surround an inviting hearth. 

>[!NOTE] Background
The Alsberg family has owned and maintained the establishment for a generation. [[Karin Alsberg]] and her husband, [[Holger Alsberg]] (both human [commoners](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16829-commoner)) make fine home-brewed beer known as Ember Ale, and serve hearty braised lamb stew with fresh-baked bread.

- A mug of fine ale costs 2 sp. A meal costs 1 gp.
- The Alsbergs keep half a dozen one-room cottages in the village that they will rent to travellers. The price is 2 gold per night.

#### Old Rattlecan

Sitting behind the Bark and Buzzard like a scarecrow, Old Rattlecan is an intelligent suit of [animated armour](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16786-animated-armor) which was found in the ruins of Drakkenheim. A mysterious magical enchantment causes it to rebuild itself when destroyed:

- [Rival adventurers](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dodr/running-the-campaign#RivalAdventurers) drinking in the Bark and Buzzard may invite player characters to “come kick the can out back”. They challenge them to see which character can defeat Old Rattlecan the fastest, or who can survive the longest before being knocked out. Adding handicaps or bizarre “house rules” are popular ways to spice up the contest, such as being blindfolded, using no weapons, or taking drinks between hits.
- Rattlecan rejuvenates after one minute when reduced to 0 hit points unless it is [disintegrated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2070-disintegrate) or [dispel magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2072-dispel-magic) is cast on its remains. Everyone in town is terribly upset if this happens.
- A creature reduced to 0 hit points by Old Rattlecan is [unconscious](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Unconscious) but stable and wakes up one minute later with 1 hit point.
- Old Rattlecan can occasionally be heard making remarks to those it fights. It yells things like “Have at thee cur!”, “‘Tis a flesh wound!” or “Was that the best you can do?” as it seems to revel in battling any challenger.
