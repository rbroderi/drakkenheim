> - **Description:** Seven standing stones comprise this ancient shrine that rests within a small grove of dying trees on the outskirts of town. Inscribed on each stone are the legends of primordial gods, and between them rests a stone pedestal adorned with various animal bones, plants, and candles that are lit every night. A crude old hut lies down a dirt path near the shrine, smoke billowing from a hole in the thatched roof chimney, and an odd scent of herbs wafting from within.

>[!NOTE] Background
The hut is home to [[Old Zoya]], an elderly elf [druid](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16848-druid) who tends the shrine. Many in town wrongfully refer to her as a witch, but hold a deep respect for the ornery mystic. She claims the shrine protects Emberwood Village through these dark times. Zoya holds no love for the Sacred Flame, and keeps faith for the old, true gods.

Old Zoya can cast druid spells of 3rd-level and lower, and knows the [purge contamination](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2221555-purge-contamination) spell and always keeps it prepared. She charges 25 gp for a 1st-level spell, 50 gp for a 2nd-level spell, or 150 gp a 3rd-level spell, plus the cost of any expensive material components.

She takes payment in coins, gems, or relics. She refuses to speak of what she does with the money, and grows impatient with anyone who gets too nosy.

Each week, Zoya brews up 1d6 [potions of healing](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/71-potion-of-healing) which she sells for 50 gold each. If paid in advance, once per day she can create a [potion of greater healing](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5133-potion-of-healing-greater) for 150 gp.
