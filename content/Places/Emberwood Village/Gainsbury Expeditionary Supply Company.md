> - **Description:** This caravan is loaded high with boxes and barrels of goods. Laid out on a small table are samples of climbing gear, cartographer’s instruments, goggles, heavy leather gloves, mining picks, torches, tongs, and assorted tools for navigation and survival in the ruins.

>[!NOTE] Background
>- Armin Gainsbury, a bespectacled and beanpole-shaped human [commoner](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16829-commoner), carries all manner of adventuring gear which they sell for twice the market value.
>- Gainsbury is especially well stocked on mining and prospecting equipment, and sells a pamphlet detailing the correct methods for safely handling and extracting [delerium crystals](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/355-delerium-crystal). A copy costs 1 gp. The information inside is filled with hyperbolic (but correct) warnings. The instructions are overly detailed and rather long-winded, but reasonably accurate.
