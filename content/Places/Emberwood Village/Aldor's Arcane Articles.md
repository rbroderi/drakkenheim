> - **Description:** This massive and heaving covered carriage is decorated with gold filigree and glimmering lanterns. Hitched beside it are two great steel-skinned oxen that exhale green fumes from their snouts. Three lanky attendants garbed in light armour and carrying crossbows patrol the grounds.<br/>Seated before the carriage on a buckling wooden chair is a massive human man who must be nearly seven feet tall and almost as wide. He is garbed in masterfully tailored jet-black silk that flatters his obese frame: a frilled doublet, padded breeches, and riding gloves, all worn under a great fur-lined cloak, topped with a feathered cap. Each piece is delicately embroidered with elegant silver trim. The smell of fine tobacco mixed with perfume hangs in the air around him. He smokes a fine black pipe and drinks from a bottle of vintage wine, a rakish grin on his flabby face. He greets characters warmly then rubs his hands together with anticipation.

>[!NOTE] Background
>- [[Aldor the Immense]] is a [djinni](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16842-djinni) who delights in mortal pleasures and freely travels the world as a dealer of exotic wares. He possesses a sharp wit, a sophisticated sense of humor, puissant skill with money, and a gluttonous appreciation for material indulgences.
>- His elemental nature is completely indiscernible, and he appears in all respects to be a grotesquely large human man. He wears an [amulet of proof against detection and location](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4569-amulet-of-proof-against-detection-and-location).
>- Aldor the Immense deals in magic items and delerium. He is accustomed to small-time heroes attempting to browbeat him, would-be seducers looking to cut a deal, and two-bit thieves trying to rip him off. He is always one step ahead in the mental bargaining game.
>- His attendants and bodyguards are three human [assassins](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16790-assassin) named Brill, Meyers, and Vandeerbeek. His oxen are both [gorgons](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16908-gorgon).
>- Aldor the Immense has commissioned the Amethyst Academy to create [arcane locks](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2003-arcane-lock) and [glyphs of warding](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2125-glyph-of-warding) to protect his wares. In addition, he has a _tiny chest_ in which he keeps his own private treasures.
