> - **Description:** An iron-bound stagecoach is parked here flanked by two massive flat-bedded wagons with stacks of leaden and steel-studded chests, overseen by a dozen armoured men. 

>[!NOTE] Background
- [[Orson Fairweather]] (a human [gladiator](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16903-gladiator)) is among the most prolific exporters of delerium operating in Emberwood Village. The stout man has a heavily scarred and aged face, and a mouth of gold teeth. He speaks little of his own history or exploits, but entertains rumours about his past life as a pirate and adventurer.
- Fairweather has a security force of a dozen [veterans](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17045-veteran), and has paid the Amethyst Academy to create [arcane locks](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2003-arcane-lock) and [glyphs of warding](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2125-glyph-of-warding) to protect his wares from thieves.

Fairweather is among the few merchants in town willing and able to purchase delerium in vast quantities. He offers half the list price in [Appendix D](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dodr/delerium-magic-spells#Delerium) and doesn’t make deals. He furiously rebukes anyone who questions his motives or asks prying inquiries about his buyers. Countless folk in distant lands purchase delerium for unknown reasons, and in the grand scheme of things, Fairweather is just a middle man.
