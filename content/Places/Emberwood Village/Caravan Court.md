> - **Description:** A marketplace has sprung up surrounding the boarded-up water well in the village square. This colourful collection of caravans, wagons, canvas tents, and makeshift stalls is the hub of commerce for adventurers, scavengers, and prospectors looking to make their fortune in Drakkenheim. Dozens of canny merchants have set up shop here to cater to the needs of the factions and explorers.

>[!NOTE] Background
Traders and new goods arrive here daily, and the market is constantly abuzz with explorers looking to sell relics and treasures unearthed in Drakkenheim, or buy equipment needed for a dangerous voyage into the city ruins. Amongst the bustle, heavily armed and armoured thugs load ponderous wagons with locked and leaden chests filled with [delerium shards](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/359-delerium-shard) for trade in distant cities. Activity carries on through the afternoon, but most pack up shortly after sunset to head to the taverns and bars for drinks.
