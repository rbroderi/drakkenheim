> - **Description:** This smithy is little more than a one-level log cabin with an overhanging thatched roof covering a workbench, stone forge, anvil, and grinding wheel. Various tools hang along the walls beside several finished weapons.

>[!NOTE] Background
Master smith [[Tobias Crowe]] (a human [veteran](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17045-veteran)) owns and operates the smithy with his son and apprentice, Peter (a [commoner](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16829-commoner)). 

- Tobias Crowe sells weapons and armour at twice the price found in the Core Rules.
- Plate armour must be made-to-order. Payment is triple the list price, paid up front, and is available in four weeks.
- He accepts payment in coins, gems, or precious metals.
- He pays half-price for salvaged equipment if he thinks he can repurpose or melt it down.
