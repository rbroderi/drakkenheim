>[!NOTE] Background
This smithy is little more than a one-level log cabin with an overhanging thatched roof covering a workbench, stone forge, anvil, and grinding wheel. Various tools hang along the walls beside several finished weapons.

Master smith Tobias Crowe (a human [veteran](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17045-veteran)) owns and operates the smithy with his son and apprentice, Peter (a [commoner](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16829-commoner)). Crowe is a quiet family man who stands six feet tall with fiery red hair and beard. He’s often drenched in sweat and soot, and wears a greasy pair of old goggles. Crowe proudly demonstrates the high quality of his work to customers, and openly criticizes the shoddy workmanship of their existing equipment. He spends most of his days repairing broken gear, and his evenings at the Bark and Buzzard, before returning home to his wife Moira and daughters Emma and Sybil. Although he lacks the spellcasting abilities to work with delerium, he dreams of one day creating a masterpiece out of the meteoric iron found in Drakkenheim.

- Tobias Crowe sells weapons and armour at twice the price found in the Core Rules.
- Plate armour must be made-to-order. Payment is triple the list price, paid up front, and is available in four weeks.
- He accepts payment in coins, gems, or precious metals.
- He pays half-price for salvaged equipment if he thinks he can repurpose or melt it down.
